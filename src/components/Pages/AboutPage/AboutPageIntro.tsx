        Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and Data Analyst with a focus on full-stack
        development and AI technologies. My career combines a solid background
        in software development with a growing expertise in data analysis and
        machine learning. I aim to embed AI into applications not just to keep
        up with tech trends, but to subtly outpace them.
